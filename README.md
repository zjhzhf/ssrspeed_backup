## Important Hint

<font size=5 color=#FF0033>Before you publicly release your speed test results, be sure to ask the node owner if they agree to the release to avoid unnecessary disputes.</font>

 - SpeedTestNet and Fast.com is no longer supported.
 - MacOS has not found a suitable way to detect libsodium, so be sure to ensure that libsodium is installed before testing nodes that use encryption methods such as chacha20.
 - Shadowsocks-libev and Simple-Obfs are recommended to be installed using a compiled installation. It is known that the Shadowsocks-libev version in the Debian repository is too low to use some new encryption methods.

## Features

- Support SpeedTestNet, Fast.com and socket download.
- Support for exporting result as json and png.
- Support batch import of configuration from GUI configuration file and SSPanel-v2, v3 subscription link.
- Support for importing data from any Json export file and re-exporting files of the specified format.
- Support WebUI

      -y, --yes             Skip node list confirmation before test.
      -C RESULT_COLOR, --color=RESULT_COLOR
                        Set the colors when exporting images..
      -s SPLIT_COUNT, --split=SPLIT_COUNT
                            Set the number of nodes displayed in a single image
                            when exporting images.

                            Select sort method in
                            [speed,rspeed,ping,rping],default not sorted.
      -i IMPORT_FILE, --import=IMPORT_FILE
                            Import test result from json file and export it.
      --debug               Run program in debug mode.


Example usage :
- python main.py -c gui-config.json --include 韩国 --include-remark Azure --include-group MoCloudPlus
- python main.py -u https://mocloudplus.com/link/ABCDEFG123456?mu=0 --include 香港 Azure --include-group MoCloudPlus --exclude HKT HKBN
- python main.py -u https://mocloudplus.com/link/ABCDEFG123456?mu=0 -t ss

The parameter priority is as follows:

> -i > -c > -u
> The above sequence indicates that if the parameter has a higher priority, the parameter will be used first, and other parameters will be ignored.
>
> --include > --include-group > --include-remark
> --exclude > --exclude-group > --exclude-remark
> The above sequence indicates that node filtering will be performed in descending order of priority.

### Web UI

    python web.py
    You can now access the WebUI through http://127.0.0.1:10870 

## Advanced Usage

 - **Rules**
	 - The program has a built-in rule matching mode that allows specific ISPs or nodes in specific regions to use specific speed sources through custom rules for "Socket" test mode.Rules need to be written in config.py. Please see config.py for more details.
- **Custom color**
   - Users can customize the color of the resulting image in config.py. See the config.py file for sample configuration.

## Web Apis
The interfaces encapsulated in web.py are as follows:

|Path| Method | Remark 
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|/getversion | GET | Get backend version information|
|/status|GET|Get backend status|
|/readsubscriptions|POST|Get subscriptions|
|/getcolors|GET|Get the color configuration owned by the backend|
|/start|POST|Start the test, note that this is a **block request**, will return "done" after the test is completed, **will not have any response**|
|/getresults|GET|Get the current test result. If the "/start" is blocked, if you need to get the result in real time, you should poll the interface, but the time should not be less than 1s, preventing the backend from taking too much performance impact test.

 - /getversion The interface is requested without any parameters. The return example after the request is successful is as follows:

~~~~
{
	"main" : "2.4.1",
	"webapi" : "0.4.1-beta"
}
~~~~
 - /status The interface is requested without any parameters. The return example after the request is successful is as follows:
~~~~
running => Running test.
stopped => Connected to the backend but no test is running
~~~~
 - /readsubscriptions The parameters and examples required to request this interface are returned as follows:
~~~~
POST => {
	"url" : "subscription url",
	"proxyType" : "Proxy Type"
}
Response (Success) => [
	{
	"Basic Config"
	}
]
Response (running) => "running" 
Response (Invalid URL) => "invalid url"
~~~~
 - /getcolors The interface is requested without any parameters. The return example after the request is successful is as follows:
~~~~
[
	{
	"Color Config"
	}
]
~~~~
 - /getresults The interface is requested without any parameters. The return example after the request is successful is as follows:
~~~~
{
	"status" : "running" or "pending" or "stopped",
	"current" : {},  //Node information currently being tested
	"results" : [] //The result array, please refer to the JSON file of the exported result for details.
}
~~~~
 - /start The parameters required to request the interface and return are as follows, **NOTE**, this interface is a **blocking interface**
~~~~
POST => {
	"testMethod" : "Test Method",
	"proxyType" : "Proxy Type",
	"testMode" : "Test Mode",
	"colors" : "Color Name", //Ignorable
	"sortMethod" : "Sort Method", //Ignorable
	"configs":[] //Standard configuration array
}
Response (Task Done) => "done"
Response (running) => "running" 
Response (No Configs) => "no configs"
